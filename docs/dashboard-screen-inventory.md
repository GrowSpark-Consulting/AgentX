# Dashboard screen inventory

Owner: Dev 3. Reviewers: Dev 1, Dev 2. Status: **draft for review**. Covers the dashboard at `/dashboard` in
`frontend/` as of 5 Oct 2026. Data shapes for each screen are in
[dashboard-screen-contracts.md](dashboard-screen-contracts.md); how the dashboard relates to the
onboarding wizard is in [frontend-architecture-map.md](frontend-architecture-map.md).

## How to read this

- **Route** is today's URL and the route proposed once the dashboard has real routes. Today every
  screen is `/dashboard` with in-memory state; `?screen=<key>` only picks the screen on first load.
- **Roles** come from `memberships.role` (`owner`, `admin`, `staff`). The split below is a **proposal
  for Raja to confirm**. Hiding a screen in the UI is only for usability; every API route and RLS policy
  must check the role on the server.
- **Data source today** is always fixture data from `frontend/fixtures/dashboard/` held in component state.
  No screen calls an API.
- **API dependency status:**
  - **EXISTS**: implemented in this repo today.
  - **HANDOVER**: specified in `docs/handover.md` but not built yet.
  - **RLS READ**: a direct Supabase read under row-level security (the handover's default for dashboard
    reads). It needs the table, view and policy, not an API route.
  - **PROPOSED**: needed by the UI but not in the handover. It needs the owner's agreement before anyone
    builds it.
- **Tenant scope**: always the signed-in user's tenant, resolved on the server from the Supabase session
  and `memberships`. No screen sends a tenant id; the `?industry=` switch is a prototype demo control
  and goes away.

### Routes that exist today

| Route | Where | What |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | root app | Liveness check |
| `GET/POST/PUT /api/inngest` | root app | Inngest function host |
| `/`, `/onboarding` | frontend | Redirect, then the onboarding wizard (client-side steps) |
| `/dashboard` | frontend | The whole dashboard (client-side screens) |

Nothing else exists. Every dependency below is HANDOVER, RLS READ or PROPOSED.

**Update, 7 Oct 2026:** the prototype moved to `/dashboard/preview` (still fixtures). Real routes now
exist for two screens; their status is under "Real route" in sections 2 and 7.

| Route | Data |
|---|---|
| `/dashboard/inbox[?chat=<id>]` | RLS READ `conversations`, `contacts`, `handoffs`, `messages`; Realtime (migration 0010) |
| `/dashboard/knowledge` | RLS READ/WRITE `services`; RLS READ `kb_documents` |

### Proposed role access

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Home | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Staff see their own hot leads and bookings; credit meter read-only |

## 1. Home

**Route:** today `/dashboard` or `/dashboard?screen=home`; proposed `/dashboard`
**Purpose:** Morning overview: credits, trial, month summary, hot leads waiting, today's bookings.
**Roles:** owner, admin, staff (staff see their own items).
**Current data source:** fixtures `shell.ts` (`RE_STATS`, `RE_HOT`, `RE_TODAY`), `plans.ts`
(`SAMPLE_BALANCES`, `TRIAL_CREDITS`, `PLAN_CREDITS`), `industries.ts`. The credit balance and banners
are computed in the browser from `?account=` and `?credits=`.
**Future API dependency:**
- `GET /api/dashboard/summary`: **PROPOSED**, Dev 2. Month stats, hot-lead list, today's bookings
  in one call.
- `GET /api/billing/balance`: **PROPOSED**, Dev 2. Wraps `getBalance()` plus plan, trial end and
  renewal date.
- Fallback per part: **RLS READ** of `leads`, `bookings`, `conversations`, `handoffs`.
**HTTP method:** GET.
**Request:** none (tenant from session). Optional `?month=YYYY-MM` later.
**Response:** `DashboardSummary` and `AccountStatus` (see contracts).
**Loading state:** Not built yet. Needs skeletons for the credit meter, 4 stat cells, 2 lists.
**Empty state:** Built (`?firstDay=1`): zero stats, "Maya is live…", empty lists.
**Error state:** Not built yet. Needs an inline retry per card, with the rest of Home still usable.
**Feature flag:** none to view. The "Maya is replying / Auto-reply off" status follows `ai_auto_reply`.
**Plan restriction:** none. Trial countdown when `tenant.status = 'trial'`.
**Tenant scope:** session tenant.
**Owner:** UI Dev 3 · summary and balance Dev 2.

## 2. Inbox

**Route:** today `/dashboard?screen=inbox[&chat=<id>]`; proposed `/dashboard/inbox`, `/dashboard/inbox/[conversationId]`
**Purpose:** Realtime chat list and conversation; AI/Human switch; lead card; suggested reply;
templates outside the 24-hour window.
**Roles:** owner, admin, staff.
**Current data source:** `shell.ts` `convs()` (conversations with messages and lead card),
`CLOSED`, `TPLS`; `industries.ts`. Sending, mode switch and template send only change local state.
**Future API dependency:**
- Conversation list and messages: **RLS READ** of `conversations`, `contacts`, `messages`, plus
  Supabase Realtime. Dev 3, schema by Dev 2.
- Lead card: `buildLeadCard(leadId)`: **HANDOVER** contract (Dev 1). Needs a read route; see contracts.
- `POST /api/conversations/:id/messages`: **HANDOVER**, Dev 3 (sends through `notify.send`, Dev 2).
- `POST /api/conversations/:id/mode`: **HANDOVER**, Dev 3.
- `POST /api/conversations/:id/suggest`: **HANDOVER**, Dev 1.
- Approved templates list: **RLS READ** of the template status table (Dev 2, schema not defined yet).
**HTTP method:** GET (RLS), POST (actions).
**Request:** message `{ body } | { template: { name, lang, params } }`; mode `{ mode: 'ai'|'human' }`.
**Response:** `Conversation[]`, `Message[]`, `LeadCard`, `SendOutcome`.
**Loading state:** Not built yet. Needs list skeleton, chat skeleton, and a pending bubble while a send is in flight.
**Empty state:** Built (`?firstDay=1`): no chats plus copy-test-link; "no filter match" is built too.
**Error state:** Not built yet. Needs a failed-send bubble with retry, a lost-realtime banner, and an `OutsideWindowError` → template prompt (the window-closed strip exists).
**Feature flag:** `ai_auto_reply` (status), `handoff_triggers`, `handoff_own_number` (takeover options).
**Plan restriction:** none to view. Own-number takeover is Growth+.
**Tenant scope:** session tenant; RLS on every table.
**Owner:** UI Dev 3 · lead card and suggest Dev 1 · send pipeline and credits Dev 2.

**Real route (7 Oct 2026):** `/dashboard/inbox`, code in `frontend/features/inbox/`.
- Built: chat list and chat (RLS reads), AI / Needs human / Human / Own number tags (mode + open
  handoff), search, All / AI handling / Needs human filters, one Realtime channel per business, loading,
  empty, error and "live updates aren't connected" states.
- Shown switched off: Unread (no unread data), AI/Human switch, message box and Send.
- Not built: lead card, suggested reply, templates, sending (`POST /api/conversations/:id/messages`
  and `/mode`). No persona or staff names exist yet, so bubbles say "AI" and "Staff".
- Database tests (`inbox_rls.test.sql`) and migration 0010 have not been run yet.

## 3. Leads

**Route:** today `/dashboard?screen=leads`; proposed `/dashboard/leads`, `/dashboard/leads/[leadId]`
**Purpose:** Kanban by stage, score and source filters, lead detail with fields and timeline.
**Roles:** owner, admin, staff.
**Current data source:** `leads.ts` (`LEADS`, `STAGES`, `OWNERS`, `RE_TIMELINE`), `industries.ts`.
Stage moves are local.
**Future API dependency:**
- `leads`, `contacts`: **RLS READ**. Pack field labels from `vertical_packs` (Dev 1).
- Lead timeline: **PROPOSED** `GET /api/leads/:id/timeline`, Dev 2 (from `audit_logs`, `messages`,
  `bookings`, `handoffs`), or a SQL view.
- Stage change and owner change: **PROPOSED** `PATCH /api/leads/:id`, Dev 3 (audit log required).
**HTTP method:** GET, PATCH.
**Request:** filters `stage`, `temperature`, `source` (query).
**Response:** `Lead[]`, `LeadDetail`.
**Loading state:** Not built yet. Needs column skeletons.
**Empty state:** Built (`?firstDay=1`).
**Error state:** Not built yet.
**Feature flag:** `lead_qualification` (scores shown only when on).
**Plan restriction:** none.
**Tenant scope:** session tenant.
**Owner:** UI Dev 3 · scoring and fields Dev 1 · timeline data Dev 2.

## 4. Calendar

**Route:** today `/dashboard?screen=calendar`; proposed `/dashboard/calendar?view=day|week&resource=`
**Purpose:** Day/week per staff or resource; reschedule, cancel, mark visited or no-show.
**Roles:** owner, admin, staff.
**Current data source:** `calendar.ts` (`DAYS`, `TODAY`, `STAFF`, `INIT`, `RE_CAL` incl. free slots),
`industries.ts`.
**Future API dependency:**
- `bookings`, `resources`, `services`: **RLS READ**.
- Free slots for reschedule: `findSlots()`: **HANDOVER** contract (Dev 2); needs a read route,
  **PROPOSED** `GET /api/bookings/:id/slots`.
- `POST /api/bookings/:id/(reschedule|cancel|complete|no-show)`: **HANDOVER**, Dev 2.
**HTTP method:** GET, POST.
**Request:** `reschedule { slot }`, `cancel { reason }`.
**Response:** `Booking[]`, `Slot[]`, updated `Booking`.
**Loading state:** Not built yet.
**Empty state:** Partly built: days with no bookings render empty.
**Error state:** Not built yet. Needs "slot was just taken" (exclusion constraint) → refresh slots.
**Feature flag:** `booking`; reminders reset on reschedule (`reminder_24h`, `reminder_2h`).
**Plan restriction:** none.
**Tenant scope:** session tenant; times shown in `tenants.timezone`.
**Owner:** UI Dev 3 · booking engine and actions Dev 2.

## 5. Features

**Route:** today `/dashboard?screen=features`; proposed `/dashboard/features`
**Purpose:** Feature toggles grouped by area, locked items with Upgrade, credits per month estimate,
reminder timing, working-hours mode.
**Roles:** owner, admin (staff view only).
**Current data source:** `plans.ts` (`FEATURES`, `GROUPS`, `PLAN_*`); toggle state, lock state and
estimate are computed **in the browser**. That has to move to the server.
**Future API dependency:**
- `GET /api/features`: **PROPOSED**, Dev 2. Features × plan × tenant toggles × 30-day usage. The
  handover says this screen is rendered from `features` + `plans`. A route keeps entitlement logic on
  the server; an RLS read of `features`, `plans` and `tenant_features` would also work if the
  estimate comes from a view.
- `PATCH /api/features/:key`: **HANDOVER**, Dev 2 (checks plan, writes audit log).
**HTTP method:** GET, PATCH.
**Request:** `{ enabled?: boolean, settings?: { offsetHours?: 48|24|12|6, mode?: '247'|'after_hours' } }`.
**Response:** `FeatureList` (see contracts: available / locked / disabled per feature).
**Loading state:** Not built yet. Needs a per-row pending switch while a PATCH is in flight.
**Empty state:** not applicable.
**Error state:** Not built yet. On PATCH failure, revert the switch and show a toast. A 403 `plan_required` opens the Upgrade dialog.
**Feature flag:** this screen is the flag UI.
**Plan restriction:** lock state per feature from the plan's `feature_keys`.
**Tenant scope:** session tenant.
**Owner:** UI Dev 3 · API Dev 2.

## 6. Agent settings

**Route:** today `/dashboard?screen=agent`; proposed `/dashboard/agent`
**Purpose:** Persona name and tone, languages, business hours, scoring weights and thresholds,
handover triggers, takeover default.
**Roles:** owner, admin.
**Current data source:** `agent.ts` (`CRIT`, `TRIG`, `LANGS`), `industries.ts` (`agent`); preview text
is fixture copy.
**Future API dependency:**
- `tenants.agent_settings`, `tenants.business_hours`, `tenants.pack_overrides`: **RLS READ**.
- Save: **PROPOSED** `PATCH /api/agent/settings`, Dev 1 (validates overrides against the pack
  with Zod; overrides cannot remove required fields or hard fails).
- Pack scoring rules and triggers: `vertical_packs` (Dev 1).
**HTTP method:** GET, PATCH.
**Request:** `AgentSettingsInput`.
**Response:** `AgentSettings`.
**Loading state:** Not built yet.
**Empty state:** not applicable (pack defaults).
**Error state:** Not built yet. Show validation errors per field (e.g. weights must total 100; the UI already shows the total).
**Feature flag:** `lead_qualification`, `handoff_triggers`, `working_hours_mode`.
**Plan restriction:** custom scoring weights are **Pro** (`custom_scoring`); own-number takeover is
Growth+ (`handoff_own_number`). Neither is locked in the prototype today.

- `POST /api/onboarding/import-site`: **HANDOVER**, Dev 1 (also used by "Sync website again").
- FAQ create/edit and answering a gap: **PROPOSED** `POST/PATCH /api/kb/faqs`, Dev 1 (must re-embed).
- Unanswered questions list: **PROPOSED** `GET /api/kb/gaps`, Dev 1 (needs a source table; not in the
  schema).
**HTTP method:** GET, POST, PATCH.
**Request:** multipart upload; `{ q, a }`.
**Response:** `KnowledgeBase`.
**Loading state:** Not built yet. Needs upload and embedding progress.
**Empty state:** Built (`?firstDay=1`).

  blocked by bookings is explained), documents list from `kb_documents` (title, source, date).
- Shown as not available, no data and no saving: unanswered questions, FAQs, Upload. The ported list
  components take the PROPOSED `KnowledgeBase.faqs` / `gaps` shapes and are wired when Dev 1's
  contracts exist (open question 3 above, `POST /api/kb/documents` shape).
- Not shown: website sync (`POST /api/onboarding/import-site` not built); a document processing

**Future API dependency:**
- Template status table: **RLS READ** (Dev 2; seeded by `whatsapp/connected`, schema not defined).
- Submit a new version: **PROPOSED** `POST /api/templates`, Dev 2. A changed template is a new
  version submitted to Meta, never an edit in place.

**Tenant scope:** session tenant.
**Owner:** UI Dev 3 · Razorpay, ledger and plans Dev 2.
**Note:** prototype prices and credits (₹1,999 / 1,000 …) differ from the v1.0 specs
(₹2,499 / 1,500 …). The specs win unless Raja decides otherwise; see `docs/dev2-roadmap.md`.
