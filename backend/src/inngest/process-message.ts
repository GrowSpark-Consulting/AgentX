// The message pipeline (docs/handover.md: `process-message`, trigger `whatsapp/message.received`). The work is
// in agent/pipeline/process-message.ts; this wires it to Inngest.
//
// - One conversation at a time (concurrency key = conversationId), so two quick messages from one customer are
//   handled in order, never in parallel.
// - Messages that arrive within 3 seconds of each other start ONE run (debounce on the conversation, and no
//   longer than 15 seconds after the first). The debounce keeps only the LAST event, so the event is only a place
//   to start looking: the run collects the customer's unanswered messages itself and answers them together.
// - Every stage is a step: a failure retries that stage (3 retries) and never repeats what finished.
//
// The pipeline: resolve, batch, lead and gate (steps 2 and 3), understand the message and search the knowledge base
// (step 4), then reply and send (step 7 and the send): ONE reply per turn, through notify.send, recorded as answered
// in the same step. The decide step (Day 3) will sit between 4 and 7; until then the action is fixed: answer from the
// knowledge base's facts, or a safe line. Every way the run can end has an answer for the customer (plan.ts).
//
// One clock for the whole turn: the first step records when it began, and every invocation works out what is left of
// the 25-second hard stop (turn-deadline.ts); the model calls stop when it passes and the customer gets the safe line.
//
// A run that still fails after its retries: `onFailure` leaves a line (ids only) and, if the customer's messages are
// still unanswered and the chat is still the assistant's, sends one safe line (give-up.ts), so nobody is left in
// silence. A sweep for messages nobody answered, like kb-sweep does for documents, is still the follow-up for a
// failure that could not even do that.
