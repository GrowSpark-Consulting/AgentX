// The message pipeline, steps 2 and 3 (docs/handover.md, "Message pipeline"): who wrote, their open lead, and
// whether the AI answers. Written against a minimal `step.run` so it is tested without Inngest, and as a plain
// function the later steps (4 extraction, 5 decide, 6 act, 7 reply, 8 charge and send) extend: `runTurn`
// returns the `TurnContext` they start from.
//
// Every stage is a step, so a failure retries that stage only and what finished is not repeated. What a step
// returns is what Inngest remembers, in its own storage: ids, flags and small facts only. A message's text, a
// phone number or a name is never returned; a later step reads what it needs from the database when it runs.
//
// The run answers a BATCH, not the one message whose event started it. Messages from one customer within a few
// seconds start one run (a debounce keeps only the LAST event), so the run collects the customer's unanswered
// messages itself, and the event is only where to look. The gate decides for the conversation (opted out, a
// person's chat, the feature off) and then for each message (a photo or voice note is left for staff, the rest
// are answered): a photo sent after a text must not take the text with it.
//
// Idempotent: a message that has been answered is skipped however often its event arrives. "Answered" is an
// audit row (ANSWERED_ACTION) that the reply step writes after it sends, for EVERY message of the batch, in the
// same step as the send (a crash between the two would otherwise send the reply twice). A repeated run finds the
// lead the first run made. The reply step must also re-read the chat's mode and the opt-out flag right before it
// sends: staff may have taken over, or the customer sent STOP, since this run looked.
