// The message pipeline, step 7 and the send (docs/handover.md, module 2): turn what step 4 found into ONE reply, check
// it, send it through notify.send, and record that the customer's messages were answered. Day 2's action is fixed
// (answer from the knowledge base's facts, or a safe line); plan.ts decides which, for every way step 4 can end, and this
// file carries it out.
//
// Steps (each a step.run; what a step returns is kept by Inngest, so only ids, flags and a case name, never text):
//   plan     the table in plan.ts, and its two side effects: the question the knowledge base could not answer is
//            recorded as a gap (once), and the chat's count of misses in a row is kept for the next turn.
//   reply    write the reply (the strong model for an answer, fixed words for everything else; the post-check; one
//            regeneration; then the safe fallback), look again at the chat's mode and the contact's opt-out, send it
//            through notify.send, and write `message.answered` for every message of the turn IN THIS STEP: a crash
//            between the send and the record would send the reply twice on retry.
//   handoff  when the plan says a person must take over (after the reply went), or the business is out of credits: the
//            handoffs row, the switch of the chat to `human`, the `handoff.opened` event (the owner's alert is Dev 2's `handoff-alert` job, from that event: the pipeline sends none).
//
// Never two replies: a step that finds the last message answered does nothing; a send whose outcome is unknown is
// treated as answered (the sender says it may have gone out); the answered rows are written with a few tries and a
// failure there is logged, never thrown (throwing would retry the step and send again).
